**HEALTHCARE ANALYSIS REPORT – POWER BI PROJECT**
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
- TechnoEdge Healthcare’s product dataset contains details
such as product IDs, categories, brands, vendor names,
manufacturer locations, unit price, shipping cost, and
insurance cost. The challenge is to analyze this data to
identify pricing trends, top-selling products, vendor
performance, and the impact of packaging and logistics
costs on overall sales.

**REQUIREMENTS SOLVED IN DASHBOARD**
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, standardized categories,
and rounded shipping cost.

- Data Transformation: Created sub-category column, merged
additional details using Product ID.

- DAX & Measures: Calculated Total Sales, Unit Price, Insurance
Cost, Pack Price, and Shipping Cost.

- Visualization:
  
- Cards → KPIs (Total Sales, Unit Price, Insurance Cost, Shipping
Cost, Pack Price)

- Bar Chart → Sales by Subcategory & Brand Name
  
- Pie/Donut Chart → Product count by Location & Subcategory
  
- Slicer → Filter data by Manufacturer Location
  
- Funnel Chart → Brand Sales
